<h1>BlockEdit</h1>
<h3>An alternative to WorldEdit for modern Paper servers.</h3>

<h3>❗ This is just a hobby project, it will never get as good as worldedit, but you're free to use it as you like.</h3>

<h3>❗ This plugin is not finished yet, it's still in development.</h3>

<h2>Perks</h2>
<ul>
<li>
    <b>No NMS</b> - This plugin doesn't use any NMS, so it doesn't require updating every time a new Minecraft version
    comes out.
</li>
<li>
    <b>Work splitter</b> - This plugin splits the work between multiple ticks by chunk. This means that it won't lag the
    server as much as WorldEdit. It will also ease the client lag when nearby updating chunks, since only set number of
    chunks will be updated per tick.
</li>
<li>
    <b>Simple API</b> - BlockEdit is made with being extendable in mind. You can add your own operations that can be used
    with the work splitter system. You can also add your own wands that can do anything you want them to do.
